            <h1>2025 in review</h1>
                <p>Well 2025 is over, lets look back at the last year</p>
                  <h2> Personal</h2>
                <p>
                  I still live in Northwest Iowa, don't plan on moving any time soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I don't think there's been any major changes to my website, and as promised, it doesn't get updated very frequently.
                </p>
                <p>I am planning on going on a trip to Argentina in February 2026 with a group of church people. Having never really left the US, I am looking forward to experiencing a different culture and growing closer with the group of 16 people going on the trip.</p>
                <p>
                  None of my home automation blew up this year, so I think that's a net positive. I got better at taking and maintaining backups at home for nothing yet.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I went to all the Iowa State Football home games with my family, what a wild season.
                </p>
                <h2>Work</h2>
                <p>
                  I continued working for RDI and Downtown Church this year, I got more involved with the Middle School ministry leading tech and teaching some of the students.
                </p>
                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>
                  I got a 3D printer and started messing around with that. Time has definitely been spent on designing useless things. On a more useful note, I had some brackets break for power supplies and other furniture, so I designed a handful of brackets to fix this.
