            <h1>12 Angry Men</h1>
                <p>This has to be one of my favorite movies. It starts out in a court room where all the facts in a case have just been presented. The Jury is tasked with deciding whether a man is guilty or not guilty of committing murder in the first degree.</p>
                <p>The jurors retire from the court room, and after a short break, they take an initial vote to see where everyone stands. It comes out with 11 men voting guilty, and 1 voting not guilty. Slowly over the course of the movie, Juror 7 begins to convince other jurors that the kid in question is not guilty.</p>
                <p>More than once this turns to heated debates, at one point one of the Jurors yells out "I'm gonna kill you", not actually meaning it literally, but further proving the point that Juror 7 makes. While not being a super common phrase, it is one that some people use in a heated argument, not literally, but out of emotion</p>
                <p>The movie cuts to close ups of the jurors faces multiple times, but this one has to be my favorite.</p>
                <img src="/images/12AngryMen.png" alt="Juror 8">
                <p>Leading up to this picture, Juror 7 calls for a blind vote on slips of paper and says he will abstain. The men vote 10 guilty, 1 not guilty. One of the more loud mouthed members of the jury, Juror 3, is asking a different member why he changed his vote, but he got the wrong person. Juror 8 seeing the other man being bullied, points out that Juror 5 did not change his vote, but he did. The close up to me represents what the accusor may be feeling throughout most of the deliberation. He got tunnel vision and refused to change his vote till the last vote.Throughout the movie, Juror 3 is loud, but doesn't make many of his own points. He mostly just copies what other men say. At the end I think, he is more swayed from his own pent up emotions about his son leaving than anything else.</p>
                <p>I don't claim to be a movie reviewer or great at ascertaining what the real point of a movie is but I think that this movie teaches a good lesson in empathy. This is something that I think we have lost in recent years. Trying to put yourself in someone elses shoes is something we should do more often. Stop thinking your way of thinking is the only way to do things.</p>
                <p>Overall I would recommend watching this movie. To me it is a great movie, filled with emotion, and subtle lessons about how to have structured civil disagreements with friends or strangers.</p>
