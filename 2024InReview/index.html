            <h1>2024 in review</h1>
                <p>Well now, 2024 is over and not much has changed, but lets see what has</p>
                  <h2> Personal</h2>
                <p>
                  I'm still living up in Northewst Iowa, and not much really goes on here. It's at least a 2 hour drive to get anywhere and I don't go traveling that much over the weekend.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I did finally get around to publishing a website but it will most likely not get updated that often. Don't expect any rapid changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I managed to blow up a Home Assistant install with a monthly update, still don't know how that happened, so I rebuilt that, and took the opportunity to change the dashboards
                  around how I wanted it. This is something that I meant to do for a while, but kept ignoring
                </p>
                <p>
                  Visiting some friends in Kansas City, we went to the National WWI museum. Being one of the few left, it had a ton of things to read, but what struck out the most to me was how long
                  it took before the US got involved. Maybe this was covered in my High School history class, but I sure couldn't remember most the things in the museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I went to all the Iowa State Football home games with my family. It was nice to go back to campus and walk around a little before the games. Made for some long nights, since
                  most of them were night games, but a ton of fun all the same.
                </p>
                <h2>Work</h2>
                <p>
                  I went to Connect IT Global in late April / early May. It was great to meet some of the vendors that I work
                  with and the account mangers. I would love to go to another one at some point, but we'll see if that actually happens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I started partly leading one of the teams at work, and this has been tough. I have been told, and know that I have things to teach other techs,
                  but teaching is not something that comes naturally to me. It took a while for me to start mentoring anyone, and I still struggle with showing people what I am doing, and not
                  plowing through the work just to get it done.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I started working for Downtown Church in Milford this year as the Director of Technology, fancy title that means I show up almost every week and make sure things run smoothly.
                  I think this has been a good growning opportunity for me to start teaching other people about how sound works. I definitly am not perfect at it, and it has forced me to expand
                  my abilities in the area.
                </p>
                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>
                  I didn't end up doing a ton of projects this year. As previously stated I barely got this website running this year.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I did get my NAS backed up this year, and it will continue to back up offsite, as part of the 3-2-1 data backup method. I was excited to get this going, since all my plex shows live on the nas
                  and I would be rather annoyed if it all dissapeared.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main project from this year was working on setting up an Active Directory environment at home. For my homelab there are two domain controllers running with multiple other domain joined PC's
                  and users. The main goal with this was to learn more about specific Group Policy issues that I ran into, and this may get torn down at some point.
